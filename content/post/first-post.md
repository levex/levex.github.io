Hello everyone.

My name is Levente Kurusa. I work on all kinds of low-level software and when
I'm not I enjoy writing Haskell programs. This blog will serve as a brain dump
and I'll be posting longer and shorter articles about everyday programming.
<!--more-->

This blog is named as is, because of the popular stereotype that programmers drink
a lot of coffee. I don't drink a lot of coffee, though instead I drink a lot of tea.
Maybe the stereotype should say programmers drink a lot, oh wait, that's something different
and sad. Oh well..

Anyway, my jokes are terrible, but if you still are interested in meeting up,
(I meet up with anyone interesting!) shoot me an email. I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area.

As always, I'm reachable on Twitter at
<a href="http://twitter.com/iLevex">@ilevex</a>.
