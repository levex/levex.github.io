Hello everyone.

My name is Levente Kurusa. I work on all kinds of low-level software and when
I'm not I enjoy writing Haskell and Scheme. This blog will serve as a brain dump
and I'll be posting shorter (sometimes longer) articles about everyday programming.
<!--more-->
Mostly about concurrency, parallelism and the occassional this-and-that. I am
located in the Bay Area at the moment and always up to meet anyone interested
to chat. I can sometimes also be found at conferences.

Right now, I'm working at Apple but returning to Imperial College London in
October to do some research and focus on my side projects. I'll be posting
about those later.

I also post (well, really, rant) on Twitter:
