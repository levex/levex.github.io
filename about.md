Hello!

Welcome to my blog about the crossroads of kernel development, haskell, osdev
and tea.

I spend the better part of my day working on operating systems; previously I've
interned at Apple and at Red Hat, all times working on OS related projects.

If you are looking to contact me, please do so via email listed at the bottom
of this page or alternatively via Twitter.
